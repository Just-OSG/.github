### **Jordan University of Science and Technology Open Source Group**

Welcome to JUST OSG! We're a student-led initiative representing open source projects from JUST students. Our mission is to showcase the innovative work happening at our university and foster a collaborative environment for student developers.


JUST OSG serves as a central hub for open source projects created by students at the Jordan University of Science and Technology. Whether you're working on web applications, hardware projects, research tools, or anything in between, we're here to give your work visibility and support.

Have a project you'd like to add to **JUST OSG**? We'd love to feature your work! Whether it's a completed project or a work in progress, [feel free to reach out](mailto:justosgroup@gmail.com).
